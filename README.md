### Hi there,
### So here goes the start of 16 weeks of Bootcamp14 with the School of Code.  Excited and nervous as this starts the process of changing my work life.
### Now at Week 10, where does time go? and still going Strong.

## A bit about me
### A chartered Mechanical Engineer aspiring to become a Full Stack Developer. In the later part of my career, I was working alongside and realised I was watching Software Developers with envious eyes. I have now embarked upon a lifechanging 16week training course to become a Full Stack Developer. I aim to bring all my experience and the ability to solve problems calmly and efficiently whilst working collaboratively with internal and external stakeholders to achieve shared goals.
