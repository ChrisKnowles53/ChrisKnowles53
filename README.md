### Hi there,
#### My name is Chris Knowles, I’m a Chartered Mechanical Engineer, I’ve swum across the English Channel and I have just graduated from The School of Code 16-week Bootcamp and looking for my first opportunity to be a Full Stack Developer.

## A bit about me
In the later part of my career, I was working alongside and realised I was watching Software Developers with envious eyes, the way they worked, the problems they were solving and how much the world of software development seemed to align with my way of thinking.

I embarked upon a life-changing 16-week training course to become a Full Stack Developer and graduated from it in July 2023.

I aim to bring all my experience and the ability to solve problems calmly and efficiently whilst working collaboratively with internal and external stakeholders to achieve shared goals.

## My Projects

Please see the README.md files in each of the project folders for more information on each project.
