### Hi there,
#### My name is Chris Knowles, I’m a Chartered Mechanical Engineer, I’ve swum across the English Channel and I am now a Software Developer.

## A bit about me
I'm a Backend Software Engineer with strong experience building and owning production Go services in AWS. Proven in delivering customer-facing features end-to-end — from ambiguous requirements through design, implementation, deployment, and on-call support. Brings a product mindset, strong operational ownership, and a track record of improving system reliability and team effectiveness.
